# Object Oriented Programming 
## Overview of datatype 
- Data type is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold and what operations can be performed on it.

- Types of data type (based on the number of value can includes in a variable / based on the storage way in the memory / based on the type of memore):
	- Single value data type / value data type / slack memory
		- primitive data type
			- int
			- float
			- char
			- boolean
		- non-primitive data type
			- string
			- array
			- object
	- Multiple value data type / collection(reference) data type / heap memory
		- collection data type
			- list
			- set
			- map

## Overview of memory
Stack: In stack items, things get on the top of each-other, means gonna be faster and more efficient to be processed!...

So there is always an index to point the specific item, also processing gonna be faster, there is relationship between the items as well!...

Heap: No order, processing gonna be slower and values are messed up together with no specific order or index... there are random and there is no relationship between them... so execution and usage time could be vary...
